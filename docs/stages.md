# Pipeline stages — what exists, what is open, what is verified

ADR-0001 records what was **decided**. This file records what is **built**. They are not
the same thing, and the difference is where the work actually is.

The stage list and the exit-code table are in
[ADR-0001 § The pipeline](../adr/0001-lecture-pipeline.md#the-pipeline).

## How to read the columns

**Code** — the module that implements the stage. Verified by reading the file.

**Code present** — `yes` means the module exists and is called from `pipeline.run`.
It does **not** mean the stage has been seen to work on a real lecture. See
[Verification](#verification-status).

**Stage fully working** — the stage ran on the 4520 s lecture and left its artefacts in a
bundle, and the last column names where its provenance is. Every stage now records something,
either a `*-provenance.json` or, for stage 4, `detect.json`. Stage 10 records none and makes no
calls — it is deterministic, and a document asserting that would be an artefact about
constants, not provenance.

| stage | provenance | what it answers |
|---|---|---|
| 1, 2 | `source-provenance.json` | what the input was, and which ffmpeg measured it |
| 3 | `stt-provenance.json` | backend, endpoint, every request field, digests of both transcripts |
| 4 | `detect.json` | the full filter chain, every setting, the ffmpeg version |
| 5–12 | `*-provenance.json` | the tool, its rule set, and what it changed |
| 6 | per-frame `caption_trace` in `captions.json` | which model captioned this frame, tokens, timing, called or cached |
| 7, 9 | `synth-`/`audit-llm-transcript.json` | every call: full messages, model, tokens, seconds, attempts |

The three LLM stages keep different amounts on purpose. Stages 7 and 9 make 8 calls each and
store the whole `messages` array — ~190 KiB per call for stage 9, which needs the section text
to be auditable. Stage 6 makes 58 and stores a summary; the full form would be ~11 MiB per
run, more than the rest of the bundle. Attribution still works: model, tokens, seconds,
attempts, fingerprint, and whether the frame was called or taken from cache.

## The table

| # | Stage | Code | Code present | Stage fully working |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | `doctor` | `deps.py`, `cli.py` | yes | yes — green with a real gateway |
| 1 | `probe` | `probe.py` | yes | **yes** — `source-provenance.json` |
| 2 | `audio` | `audio.py` | yes | **yes** — same document |
| 3 | `stt` | `stt/` — `core`, `backends`, `whispercpp`, `openai_compat` | yes | **yes** — 4520 s, 4901 segments via the proxy |
| 4 | `frames` | `frames.py` | yes | **yes** — 58 frames, deterministic |
| 5 | `quality` | `quality.py` — `GeometricEstimator` | yes | **yes** — 57/58 pass, threshold 37320 |
| 6 | `caption` | `caption.py`, `llm.py` | yes | **yes** — 58 frames, per-frame `caption_trace` |
| 7 | `synth` | `synth.py` | yes | **yes** — 8/8 sections, 8 LLM calls recorded |
| 8 | `lint` | `lint.py` | yes | **yes** — 9 checks, clean |
| 9 | `audit` | `audit.py` | yes | **yes** — 4 rules, tier 2 ran, 8 LLM calls recorded |
| 10 | `repair` | `repair.py` | yes | **yes** — deterministic, nothing to repair |
| 11 | `link` | `link.py` | yes | **yes** — 34 terms, 96 links |
| 12 | `report` | `report.py` | yes | **yes** — 8 verified, frames 58/58 |

Stages 7–10 and 1–2 are not "broken" or "missing". They are written, imported by
`pipeline.run`, and covered by `tests/test_stages.py`. What they lack is a **verified run
over the lecture**, which is a different and cheaper claim to earn.

## Stage 6 — what was added, and what it is still not

Stage 6 was two halves: a deterministic alignment that worked, and a captioning half that
had **no vision client at all**. `llm.py` was text-only — `grep -niE 'image|vision|b64|base64|multimodal|image_url' src/glimpse/llm.py` returned nothing — and `caption.py` said so itself:

```
captioning is NOT_CONFIGURED -- no vision client in this codebase
```

That string is gone. Stage 6 now builds an OpenAI-compatible message carrying the frame as
a `data:` URI and calls the same `chat()` the text stages use; the transport was never the
missing part, only the message shape and the configuration were.

**Verified live**, 2026-10-04, against `http://100.64.0.2:8317/v1` with
`opencode-go/glm-5.3-flash`, on two real frames from lecture 1:

| frame | time | result |
|---|---|---|
| `f_0000000000.jpg` (53 KiB) | 1.5 s | `NO NEW INFORMATION` — a title screen with nothing the audio did not already carry |
| `f_0000617096.jpg` (163 KiB) | 4.6 s | a full transcription of the references page: four numbered courses, the first literature entry, and the screen-share banner occluding a line |

58 frames took **446.8 s** of wall clock for the whole stage -- 7.7 s per frame, and
**88% of every LLM call the pipeline makes**. `caption_trace` in `captions.json` records
the model, tokens, timing and whether each frame was called or cached; see #81.

The second caption also shows the provenance chain working: `served_model` came back as
`glm-5.3-flash` while the requested id was `opencode-go/glm-5.3-flash`. Both are recorded,
and the disagreement is visible rather than resolved silently (#61).

### Failure behaviour, which changed deliberately

The old code wrote `caption_status: NOT_CONFIGURED` into the artefact and exited 0. Now:

| Situation | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| No vision endpoint | every frame marked `NO_ENDPOINT`, run **continues**, exit non-zero |
| Endpoint configured but refusing | per-frame `ERROR` with the endpoint's message |
| Every frame failed | exit 3, `DEPENDENCY_FAILED`, with the per-frame reasons |
| Caption returned but empty | `EMPTY`, counted as a failure |

The first row follows the contract stage 7 already has: `TemplateSynthesizer` exists so the
pipeline runs end to end with no model configured, and stage 6 must not be the stage that
breaks it. A note written without slide content is a worse note, not no note — but it is a
worse note the run must say out loud.

## Stage 5 is **not** open, despite what the code used to say

`resolve_estimator` registered three names. `vlm` raised `NotConfiguredError` on both
branches, so `GLIMPSE_BBOX_SOURCE=vlm` failed at the crop instead of being refused as the
unknown name it is. It has been removed from the registry (#67): a vision bbox source is a
real idea that is still unbuilt, and an unbuilt option should be absent rather than present
and broken.

Stage 5 itself works through `GeometricEstimator`, the default.

## Verification status

**1. A full 12-stage run including stage 6.** Done, repeatedly. Run 3 on
`1_lecture_OCS.mp4` (4520 s, AV1 1080p): 58 frames detected and gated, 58 captioned with 0
failures, note 53.5 kB, lint `9 checks, 0 errors, 0 warnings`, stage 12
`8 verified, 0 optional absent, frames 58/58`, exit 0 in 1935.6 s.

**2. The suites are still not hermetic.** `tests/test_stages.py` and `tests/test_doctor.py`
read ambient `GLIMPSE_*` and fail when those are exported. Pre-existing, reproduced on
pristine `main`, filed as #63. "The tests pass" still means "the tests pass in a clean shell".

Two variables are pinned by this work rather than deferred to #63, because the changes that
introduced them also introduced writes. Without the pin, running the suite created
`~/.config/glimpse/settings.toml` holding the developer's real vault path, and wrote
`audio.wav`, `transcript.txt`, `transcript.json` and `transcript.raw.json` into
`~/Documents/obs_notes/glimpse/`. `GLIMPSE_SETTINGS` also belongs in the CI scrub list.

**3. Compared against the hand-written baseline.** Run 7's `note.linked.md` against
`Лекция 1. 01.10.26.md` (64150 bytes), re-measured rather than carried forward:

| | baseline | generated |
|---|---:|---:|
| bytes | 64150 | 50903 |
| words | 4841 | 3808 |
| `## N.` sections | 8 | 8 |
| unnumbered `##` | 1 | 0 |
| wikilinks | 159 | 96 |
| display `$$..$$` | 10 | 6 |
| inline `$..$` | 122 | 51 |
| tables (rows) | 90 | **0** |
| `### N.M` subsections | 18 | **0** |
| `[неразборчиво]` | 3 | 18 |

The section skeleton matches: 8 `## N.` headings either way. The two structural gaps belong
to the synthesizer skill, not the pipeline, and are recorded in #74 with the measurements.
They are also the user's explicit call — "оставить, записать как issue" — so the pipeline
does not paper over them.

`[неразборчиво]` at 18 against 3 is a stage-3 transcription artefact, not a synthesis one:
run 6's audit flagged the contradiction, where a marker appeared inside a span the transcript
renders in full. #49 is the underlying measurement.

## Where the note is written

`glimpse process` exports into the vault by default, into `<vault>/glimpse/`. The vault
resolves `--vault-path` → `$GLIMPSE_VAULT` → the `vault` key in
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/glimpse/settings.toml` → `~/Documents/obs_notes`, and the settings file is
written on a first run with nothing configured. Before this, a run with no flag wrote nothing
to the vault at all and left the note in `~/.local/state/glimpse/` (#71).

The subdirectory is not cosmetic: a bundle is ~170 files, 25 in the bundle root and 145 under
`images/`, and the vault root is where the user's own notes live. A vault path that does not
exist is reported and named, never created — `export_to_vault` ends in `mkdir(parents=True)`,
so exporting to a typo would materialise an empty directory that `glimpse doctor` then
certifies as healthy.

## Claims in the code that are now true

`src/glimpse/stages.py` states:

```python
IMPLEMENTED = 12
REMAINING_NOTE = "every stage in ADR-0001 § The pipeline is built"
```

Both were false while stage 6 had no vision client, and both are true as of #67. The count in
every progress line is an accurate claim again.

Two defects in those six lines were real and are fixed:

- **The citation was wrong.** The module said "every stage D3 lists". `D3` is about reading
  frames from the source; the twelve-stage list is in ADR-0001 § *The pipeline*. An instance
  of the unqualified `D<n>` problem in #66 where the number did not merely collide, it
  pointed at the wrong decision.
- **The module's own docstring gave the rule the constant broke** — "`[6/12] caption` on a
  six-stage pipeline is a claim about the software, not a formatting preference."

What `IMPLEMENTED = 12` still is not: a measurement. It is a declaration. If a stage is ever
opened again, this constant is what will keep claiming the stage is closed, and nothing in
the test suite catches that.
