# The bundle — what a run writes

The bundle lives in `$XDG_STATE_HOME/dyak/<lecture>/` by default (`$DYAK_OUTPUT_DIR` or
`--output-dir` name it explicitly). The root is **flat**: `images/` is the only subdirectory.

Produced by run 13, `1_lecture_OCS.mp4` (4520 s): 30 entries in the root, 58 frames under
`images/`.

## Root files, by writer

| file | written by | what it is |
|---|---|---|
| `transcript.raw.json` | stage 3 `stt` | the endpoint's payload, untouched |
| `transcript.json` | stage 3 `stt` | structured transcript, with word timings |
| `transcript.txt` | stage 3 `stt` | plain text |
| `manifest.tsv` | stage 4 `frames` | frame index: timestamp, path, reason |
| `detect.json` | stage 4 `frames` | the ffmpeg filter chain and settings actually used |
| `quality.json` | stage 5 `quality` | per-frame sharpness and the gate decision |
| `captions.json` | stage 6 `caption` | per-frame captions and `caption_trace` (model, tokens, timing, called or cached) |
| `synth.json` | stage 7 `synth` | the synthesis state; the note chain is `note.md` → `note.repaired.md` → `note.linked.md` |
| `note.md` | stage 7 `synth` | the note as synthesised |
| `lint.json` | stage 8 `lint` | mechanical gate findings, before the audit |
| `audit.json` | stage 9 `audit` | findings, each with its quoted line |
| `repair.json` | stage 10 `repair` | what was changed and what was declined |
| `note.repaired.md` | stage 10 `repair` | the note after repair |
| `link.json` | stage 11 `link` | wikilinks inserted |
| `note.linked.md` | stage 11 `link` | the note after linking |
| `report.json` | stage 12 `report` | what stage 12 verified, and what it did not find |
| `timings.json` | `pipeline` | wall clock per stage and the total; written after stage 12, not a registered artefact |

`note.synth.md` does not exist: `Bundle.publish` names published files by their source
basename, and stage 7 publishes `note.md` plus `synth.json`.

## Provenance — one file per stage

Every stage writes a `*-provenance.json` recording what produced its output:

| stages | provenance | what it answers |
|---|---|---|
| 1, 2 | `source-provenance.json` | what the input was, and which ffmpeg measured it |
| 3 | `stt-provenance.json` | backend, endpoint, every request field, digests of both transcripts |
| 4 | `detect.json` (see above) | the full filter chain, every setting, the ffmpeg version |
| 5–12 | `quality`/`caption`/`synth`/`lint`/`audit`/`repair`/`link`/`report`-provenance.json | the tool, its rule set, and what it changed |
| 6 | per-frame `caption_trace` in `captions.json` | which model captioned this frame, tokens, timing, called or cached |
| 7, 9 | `synth-llm-transcript.json`, `audit-llm-transcript.json` | every call: full messages, model, tokens, seconds, attempts |

The three LLM stages keep different amounts on purpose. Stages 7 and 9 make 8 calls each and
store the whole `messages` array — ~190 KiB per call, needed so the audit is checkable. Stage
6 makes 58 and stores a summary; the full form would be ~11 MiB per run, more than the rest of
the bundle. Attribution still works: model, tokens, seconds, attempts, fingerprint, and
whether the frame was called or taken from cache.

## The scratch work dir

`audio.wav` (137.9 MiB on lecture 1) and everything else stage 2–12 work through goes to a
temporary work dir, removed when the run succeeds; `--keep-workdir` keeps it, `--workdir`
names its parent.

## `report.json` — what stage 12 actually verified

| field | meaning |
|---|---|
| `ok` | the overall verdict |
| `verified` / `absent` / `missing` | artefacts checked on disk, expected-but-absent optional ones, and required-but-not-found ones |
| `frames_expected` / `frames_found` | frame count against `manifest.tsv` |
| `note_promoted` | whether the vault copy happened |
| `files_checked` | files whose presence stage 12 confirmed (65 of 144 on run 13 — the gap is [#87](https://github.com/nicklin11/dyak/issues/87)) |
| `files_in_bundle_excluding_this_stage` | everything present on disk the stage could have checked (144) |
| `unchecked` | the absolute list of files stage 12 did not check |

Since `5c66731`, a reader can compute the coverage claim from the artefact itself: `verified ∪
unchecked = files_in_bundle_excluding_this_stage`.
