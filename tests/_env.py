"""Make a test suite independent of the developer's shell.

The suites read `DYAK_*` through `deps.Config.from_env()` and `resolve_vault()`, which is
correct for the tool and wrong for a test: whatever the developer has exported changes what
the code under test sees. Two failures follow from that, both reproduced on pristine `main`
and filed as #63.

    AttributeError: '_HealthResponse' object has no attribute 'status'

`deps.check_llm` takes the real network path because `DYAK_LLM_ENDPOINT` happens to be
set, so the suite's own stub is never consulted -- and the crash happens before `check_llm`
returns, so the suite dies at module scope with zero checks printed rather than accumulating
failures. In `test_stages.py` the same cause shows up as

    AssertionError("expected NotConfiguredError")

because the ambient configuration is *working correctly* and the assertion cannot tell that
apart from a mistake. A suite whose result depends on the shell cannot gate anything; it is
green on CI only because CI exports nothing.

The fix is to clear the prefix rather than a hand-maintained list of names: #68 added
`DYAK_GATEWAY_URL`, and a scrub list would have missed it the same way it missed the last
four. Anything that is genuinely `DYAK_*` belongs in a test's own arrangement, set after
`isolate()` and therefore unaffected by it.
