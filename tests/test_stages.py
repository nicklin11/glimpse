"""Regression: stages 1-3 honour the ADR-0001 contracts, not just their happy path.

Stage 0 pinned the exit-code contract before other stages could invent their own.
The same applies here, and these tests are mostly about the *unhappy* paths,
because that is where this pipeline's real failures live:

  * a dependency that is absent (2) versus present and failing (3), and the
    failure's stderr arriving byte-for-byte rather than as a paraphrase;
  * artefacts verified on disk, so an ffmpeg run that exits 0 having written
    nothing is caught instead of trusted (ADR-0001 D3);
  * word timings consumed as seconds from the endpoint's JSON, never reparsed out
    of stdout text, and BPE pieces left alone rather than detokenised by guess.

`runner.run` is stubbed throughout: no real ffmpeg, no whisper.cpp, no network.
The one real end-to-end run lives outside this file, in the acceptance notes.
