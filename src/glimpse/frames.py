"""Stage 4 — frames: two-pass extraction of distinct on-screen states (ADR-0001 D3).

The screen of a lecture changes slowly; the cursor moves constantly. Sampling every N
minutes yields ~99% duplicates, and running `mpdecimate` on a raw frame catches the cursor
— tens of frames per second. Hence the split:

  1. `detect()` — full decode at reduced width, blur, `mpdecimate`, `select` on change.
     The blur here is **only** a detector pre-filter.
  2. `extract_at()` — seek the **original source** per timestamp, emit one frame.

The blur physically cannot reach the output files, because pass 1 writes only timestamps
into a temp dir that is deleted immediately. That is the bug this design exists to prevent:
an earlier version blurred on the way *out*, and every emitted frame was mush — measured
Laplacian variance 1–3.6 against 686–3483 for the correct path.

Ported from `lecture-frames` (294 lines, previously untracked in `~/.local/bin`). It is a
move, not a rewrite: the working code was the only place the D3 bug fixes existed.
