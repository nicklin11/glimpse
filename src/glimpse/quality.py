"""Stage 5: crop to the document when there is one, then gate on what the source encodes.

Three things changed after the first version of this stage was measured on real frames. All
three are recorded here because the previous docstring asserted things that turned out to be
wrong, and a stage that documents its own numbers is the only thing standing between this
pipeline and another confident mistake.

## The metric is MEGE, not Laplacian variance

Laplacian variance was measuring content density. Five lecture-1 frames whose *per-edge*
Laplacian sharpness is constant (0.036-0.045) were selected, so their stroke sharpness is
equal by construction:

| frame | edge pixels | Laplacian variance |
|---|---|---|
| f_0000000000 | 8 183 | 294.8 |
| f_0004514556 | 22 692 | 1 021.0 |
| f_0003799751 | 42 514 | 1 741.7 |
| f_0004075763 | 43 181 | 1 927.4 |
| f_0002825607 | 48 860 | 2 124.4 |

**7.21x spread at equal stroke sharpness.** Pearson r(edge count, variance) = 0.841. A
threshold on that number separates slides by how much text is on them, not by whether it is
readable.

The replacement is MEGE, the mean of `Gx^2 + Gy^2` over pixels above a noise floor. The edge
population divides density out: ten times the text gives ten times the edge pixels and ten
times the gradient sum, so the mean is unchanged. Measured over the same five frames, MEGE
spreads **1.66x** where Laplacian variance spreads 7.21x. It is not a perfect fix -- stroke
*width* still moves the value, because a 72 pt header and 12 px body text have genuinely
different gradient slopes at identical focus -- but it is a 4.3x reduction, and the residue is
content rather than focus.

## The gate reads the frame before this stage touches it

Same argument as before, and it still holds: the post-enhancement number is a property of this
stage's parameters and of the encoder, not only of the image. Order is
crop -> measure (the gate) -> upscale -> unsharp -> measure again (recorded, never gated).

Through the written artefact the enhancement amplification is modest -- x1.04 for a 2x
lanczos upscale, x1.24 with unsharp, x1.38 cropped and sharpened. Piping the same chain to
`rawvideo` instead gives **x12.1**, because DCT quantisation at q=2 removes most of the
energy the upscale created. That gap is the reason this module refuses to be measured through
a proxy.

## Stage 4 hands over PNG, and it matters less than it looks

Re-extracting every lecture-1 frame as lossless PNG and measuring both through the real
analysis path gives a Laplacian variance delta of **-1.02% to -1.53%, mean -1.26%**. The
640-wide rescale that preceded the measurement destroys block-edge energy before the
Laplacian operator sees it, so the predicted "compression artifacts dominate the metric"
failure is real in mechanism and roughly one percent in magnitude. Stage 4 writes PNG anyway
because a known signed bias does not belong in a gate, but this is hygiene, not a rescue.

## The threshold is derived from the decay curve, not from a gap in a sample

The old threshold of 300 was picked from the gap between 298 and 1014 across 16 frames of one
lecture. Blur injection says where the boundary belongs: MEGE falls to **half** its
unblurred value at sigma 0.8-1.0 on every one of the 16 frames, tightly. So the gate is
placed at `decay * median(MEGE over the run's own frames)`, with `decay = 0.43` taken from that
sigma=1.0 half-value point.

Taking the *minimum* across frames instead, at a fixed sigma, was proposed and rejected by
measurement: it evaluates to 24 025, and all 16 frames score above it, so the gate would pass
everything. A minimum is the wrong order statistic for a gate -- it is dragged down by the
worst frame you happened to capture.

The normalisation is what makes the number portable. An absolute MEGE threshold would not be:
MEGE depends on stroke width, contrast and resolution, so it is not a unit that transfers
between lecture series. The ratio does.

## A frame is never rejected for not being a white page

The previous version returned `passed=False` whenever no bright region was found, which turned
a layout heuristic into a quality gate. It threw away two frames scoring 85 580 and 91 629 --
middle of the passing distribution, ~200 000 edge pixels each -- because their canvas is dark.
Dark-mode Beamer themes, MATLAB canvases, terminals and blackboards are valid content for
this lecture.

Now the outcome is three orthogonal measurements rather than one verdict:

- `quality_gate`: focus only, the thing this stage exists to decide.
- `content_type`: `white_document` | `dark_canvas` | `unknown`.
- `crop_state`: `cropped` | `full_frame_fallback`.

and a bbox that cannot be found falls back to the full frame. A frame that is genuinely blank
fails for that reason -- `f_0000304132` has luma std 10.2 and a 99th percentile of 45, and no
sharpness number is meaningful there -- which is a different failure from failing for blur.

## What this stage cannot fix

The source is VP8 at 1.6 Mbps. Interpolation adds no information. Small on-screen text is
already gone and cannot be recovered by resampling or sharpening -- only made more
plausible-looking. A frame below the threshold is reported with its measured value, not
silently dropped and not silently passed through.
