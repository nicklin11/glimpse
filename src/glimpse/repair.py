"""Stage 10: repair what can be repaired mechanically, and say what was not.

D5: repair is a proposal, never a silent rewrite. The original note is kept; this stage
writes `note.repaired.md` beside it and `repair.json` naming every change and every finding
it declined to touch. A repair the reader cannot audit is indistinguishable from corruption.

## What is repairable

Only findings whose correction is unambiguous and local:

- unbalanced `$` / `$$` -- close the delimiter, or escape a stray one
- an empty `$$` block -- delete it
- a section that declares itself empty and then is not -- restore the honest marker
- glossary drift -- substitute the canonical term

## What is not

Dimension mismatch, unsourced numbers, and every tier-2 critic finding. These need a
judgement about what the lecturer meant, and a mechanical substitution would produce a
plausible-looking note that is wrong in a new place. They are carried into `repair.json`
under `declined`, which is the point: the note is written either way, and the reader is told
exactly which parts of it are still suspect.

## Idempotence

Running repair twice changes nothing the second time. Stated as a test, because a repair
stage that appends a closing delimiter on every run would silently grow the note, and the
only symptom would be a note that gets worse every time the pipeline runs.
