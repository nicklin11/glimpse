"""Stage 3 core: the normalised transcript types, the parser, and the writers.

ADR-0001 D2: STT is delegated, never reimplemented. The wav is posted to a whisper.cpp endpoint
and the raw `segments` payload comes back over HTTP. Two properties of that payload
drove the design, both measured on this host rather than assumed:

  * the default `response_format=json` returns **only** `{"text": ...}`. Segments
    exist solely under `verbose_json`, so there is nothing to read off the plain
    transcript. Timestamps are read from the `--timestamps json` form, never
    reparsed out of stdout text;
  * `start`/`end` are **seconds as floats**, not milliseconds. A parser that
    assumed ms would place every segment past the end of a 73-minute lecture.

**Word timings are the useful payload, and they are kept unassembled.** Per-word
`start`/`end` is what stages 5-7 need to bind a frame to a paragraph; segment
edges are decoder artefacts and will not line up with paragraph structure. But
the `word` field holds **BPE subword pieces**, not words -- a 25 s probe yields
`" Ин"`, `"ст"`, `"ит"`, `"ут"` for one word. Re-joining them needs the
tokenizer's vocabulary to be exactly the one whisper.cpp was built against, and a
wrong guess silently corrupts the transcript while leaving every timestamp
plausible. So the pieces are carried verbatim, and the human-readable transcript
is built from segment `text`, which whisper.cpp already detokenised.

Three artefacts are written, because three different consumers want different
things and collapsing them loses data we do not yet understand:

  * `transcript.raw.json` -- the payload exactly as the endpoint returned it
    (`tokens`, `t_dtw`, `avg_logprob` included), so nothing is discarded;
  * `transcript.json`     -- normalised: text stripped, timings coerced, plus
    run-level metadata. This is what later stages read;
  * `transcript.txt`      -- `[hh:mm:ss] text` per segment, for a human or an
    agent reading the lecture linearly.
