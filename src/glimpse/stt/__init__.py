"""Stage 3 — transcription.

D2 (amended 2026-10-03): STT is delegated, never reimplemented, and it is delegated to
*an endpoint*, not to a particular utility. `TranscriptionBackend` is the boundary;
whisper.cpp native and an OpenAI-compatible server are the two implementations.

Everything below the backend is unchanged and shared:

- the parser is the same for every backend, because the payload is the same. whisper.cpp
  native `/inference` returns an object carrying `segments`; some servers return the bare
  array instead, and `openai_compat` unwraps either;
- `start`/`end` are **seconds as floats**, not milliseconds, in every one of them;
- per-word `word` fields are **BPE subword pieces** (`" Ин"`, `"ст"`, `"ит"`), carried
  verbatim and never reassembled — that needs whisper.cpp's exact vocabulary, and a wrong
  guess corrupts the transcript while leaving every timestamp plausible;
- the default `response_format=json` returns **only** `{"text": ...}`. Timings exist only
  under `verbose_json`.

**The word-coverage check is the reason this stage can be delegated safely.** Stages 5-7
bind frames to paragraphs by word span, so a backend that returns segments without words
does not degrade — it removes the mechanism the rest of the pipeline is built on. Coverage
is counted from the parsed result, never inferred from an exit code, and a transcript with
zero timed words is exit 3.
