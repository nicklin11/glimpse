"""Stage 6: put each frame next to the words being spoken when it was on screen.

Deterministic, and deliberately so. The useful work here is temporal alignment: every frame
stage 5 passed gets the slice of transcript that was live while it was displayed. That is
arithmetic over timestamps, not inference, and putting a model in the middle of it would
make the one part of this stage that can be verified the one part that cannot be.

Alignment is by *overlap*, not by nearest-timestamp. A frame is on screen from the moment
the previous frame was replaced until it is replaced itself, so it corresponds to the
interval `[previous_pts, pts)` -- for the first frame, `[0, pts)`. Selecting segments that
merely start nearest to the frame would drop everything said while a slide sat there, which
for a 180 s slide gap is most of the lecture.

## What this stage does not do

It does not OCR. Recovering text from the frame is a separate concern from captioning it,
and adding a binary dependency for it would make stage 6 unable to run at all on hosts that
only need the alignment.

## Captioning

Captioning is inference, so it is separated from alignment in three ways: it runs after the
deterministic half has already produced its answer, it never feeds back into the alignment,
and its results are cached by `(frame fingerprint, model id)` so a re-run that changed the
transcript but not the slides does not pay for the same caption twice.

A stage that cannot run must say so rather than write a string that reads like content. If
no vision endpoint is configured, `run()` raises `NotConfiguredError`; it does not produce
`caption: null` in the artefact and call the run clean.

The vision endpoint has its own configuration names (`GLIMPSE_VLM_*`) and falls back to the
text ones, per ADR-0004 D3: separate names because the roles are separate, not because they
have to be separate places.
