"""An OpenAI-compatible chat client, with nothing else in it.

No SDK. `urllib` and `json` cover the whole surface -- POST to `/chat/completions`, read
`choices[0].message.content` -- and an SDK would add a dependency whose failure modes nobody
here has measured, for one endpoint shape. It is also what makes the provenance chain in
ADR-0004 D4
possible: every call records the exact bytes sent and received, which is not something a
provider library hands you.

## The model id

A reply carries **two** ids and they are not the same question.

`Reply.model` is what was *requested* -- the id in `Config`, which is what a reader needs in
order to reproduce the call. `Reply.served_model` is what the endpoint *reported*, or `None`
when it reported nothing.

They can disagree, and on this host's gateway they always do: the gateway routes by provider
prefix and answers with the upstream's name instead, so `opencode-go/glm-5.3-flash` returns as
`glm-5.3-flash`. With `force-model-prefix: true` the reported id is not routable at all --
replaying it returns `400 unknown provider`. Writing that into the artefact would make the
provenance chain record a call that cannot be repeated, so the reported id is recorded beside
the requested one and the two are left to disagree in the open.

## What it does not do

- **Retries on 4xx.** A 400 means the request is wrong; repeating it identically just burns
  the lecture's time budget. 429 and 5xx are retried, because those are transient by
  definition.
- **Stream.** ADR-0001 D7 forbids it: stage 7's progress cannot be estimated from a token count, and
  a partial note is not a note.
- **Guess at a missing key.** The endpoint may be keyless (a local llama-swap, the tailnet
  gateway) or may require one. Unset means send no `Authorization` header, which both of
  those accept. Guessing a placeholder key would produce a 401 that looks like an auth
  problem when it is a config one.
