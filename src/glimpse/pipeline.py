"""Stage orchestration for `glimpse process`.

Stages 1-4 live here. Stage 0 (`doctor`) runs in the CLI before this is called,
because its output is a rendered report rather than a pipeline artefact, and
stages 5-12 are not built yet.

**Progress is reported as stage lines, and the unbuilt stages are named.** ADR-0001 D7's
reason for stage-level progress is that the STT backend issues one blocking HTTP
request with no streaming, and a bar that reads 90% during a 23-minute transcribe
and then sits still is a lie about where the time went. The same argument applies
to the stages that do not exist yet: a run that stops after stage 3 and reports
"done" would misrepresent a partial pipeline as a finished one. So the last line
of every run states what is still missing and which issue tracks it.
