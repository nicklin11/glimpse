"""The output bundle: what a run leaves behind.

Separate from `workspace.py` because the two have opposite lifecycles. The work dir is
scratch: it is removed on success unless asked otherwise. The bundle is the deliverable
and must survive. Folding them together would mean either keeping 137.9 MiB of extracted
audio on every successful run, or deleting the note.

**The default is `$XDG_STATE_HOME/glimpse/<lecture>`, not `./output/<lecture>`.** ADR-0001 D9
exists because artefacts written into a working directory end up in whatever repository
the user happened to be standing in. A CWD-relative default reintroduces that one level
down: run it from a git checkout and a 137.9 MiB wav plus a 3.7 MB transcript land in the
tree. XDG_STATE_HOME is per-user, per-purpose, and the conventional home for exactly this.

The vault is an **export target**, not the root. `export_to_vault` copies finished files
and verifies each one landed. Two write paths with different semantics is how a tool ends
up with half a note in the vault, so there is only ever one writer and the destination is
checked.

        A copy, never a move: the bundle stays the single writer, and a failed export

        `subdir` is not decoration. A lecture bundle is ~138 artefacts, 23 of which land in
        the bundle root and 115 in `images/`, so exporting with `subdir=None` scatters ~138
        files into the vault root -- which for an Obsidian vault is the directory holding the
        user's own notes. The CLI therefore always passes a subdir; this default is the
        fallback for direct callers, and it is a directory of its own for the same reason.

        `images` defaults to **False**, and the frames are 84% of the bytes. Measured on
        lecture 1 exported to the vault: 59 MiB total, of which 50 MiB was `images/` and
        9.5 MiB everything else. And the note refers to no frame at all -- zero `![[...]]`
        embeds, zero frame filenames, only time ranges like `### Фрагмент 1 (0–414 с)`.

        So by default the export was copying 50 MiB per lecture into a directory that
        Obsidian indexes and that obsidian-git synchronises, for files nothing reads. The
        frames are the pipeline's evidence and they stay in the bundle, which is where the
        audit and a later re-run both look for them. `--vault-images` copies them too, for
