"""Stage 8: lint the note against the rules, deterministically.

No model. Every check here is either a delimiter count or a string match, and a model
producing a *probabilistic* verdict about whether `$...$` is balanced is strictly worse than
a counter. This stage is the mechanical floor under stage 7's prose: the model is creative,
this is the part that is not.

## What is checked, and why each one

The checks are the failure modes this pipeline has already demonstrated it can produce. Nothing
here is a style preference.

- **Structure.** The synthesizer skill fixes eight sections in an order
  (`~/.dsh/skills/academic-lecture-synthesizer/SKILL.md`, § "Структура выходного
  документа"). A note missing section 5 is not a note that failed a lint; it is a
  different document, and stage 9's reviewer needs to know which one it is looking at.
- **Delimiter balance.** An unclosed `$` turns the rest of the note into mathematics. It is
  the single most damaging thing a synthesis model does to a technical note, and it is
  trivially detectable.
- **Links inside math.** `[[term]]` inside `$...$` breaks both the math and the link. The
  term linker runs after this stage and has no way to know it is inside math.
- **Filler.** `ну`, `как бы`, `вы поняли` survive ASR into prose. A note carrying them reads
  as a transcript that was not read.
- **Contradictory math markers.** A note that claims `не затрагивается` in one section and
  then writes three paragraphs in another is lying about its own completeness.
- **Asset references.** A `![[frame.png]]` pointing at a file not in the bundle is a broken
  link in the vault.

## Severity

`ERROR` fails the gate (exit 4). `WARN` is reported and the note is written: a note with a
warning is still more useful than no note, and a bad note beats a missing one provided the
defects are named. Suppressing a note because it has a warning would make the tool useless
exactly when the source is worst.
